	"abstract": "Despite significant interest in the research community, the development of multi-camera applications is still quite challenging. This paper presents Ella - a dedicated publish/subscribe middleware system that facilitates distribution, component reuse and communication for heterogeneous multi-camera applications. We present the key components of this middleware system and demonstrate its applicability based on an autonomous multi-camera person tracking application. Ella is able to run on resource-limited and heterogeneous VSNs. We present performance measurements on different hardware platforms as well as operating systems.",
