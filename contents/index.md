I am a PhD student at the [Safety and Security Department][1] of the [Austrian Institute of Technology][2],
where I am working together with Roman Pflugfelder, Csaba Beleznai, Branislav Micusik and David Schreiber.
My PhD supervisor is Horst Bischof from the [Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision][3]
at the [Graz University of Technology][4].

My research interests are novel [computer vision][5] algorithms for [object tracking][6].
I am specifically interested in developing methods that are applicable to a wide range of object classes and scenarios
while not requiring any manual adaptation or re-training (model-free object tracking).

On this page you can find a [C++ implementation of OpenTLD](/tld),
a tracking algorithm that sparked [quite some interest in popular media][7]
as well as a list of all my [publications](/publications).
I also maintain a [blog](/blog).
