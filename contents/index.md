title: About me

<img class='sidecolumn' style='border: 2px solid black' width='200' src='portrait.jpg' alt='My portrait' />

I am working as a Data Scientist at [Locatee][1] in Zurich, Switzerland on indoor localization using Wifi data.

Previously, I was a PhD student at the Austrian Institute of Technology,
where I worked together with Roman Pflugfelder.
My PhD supervisor was [Horst Bischof][2] from the Institute for Computer Graphics and Vision
at the Graz University of Technology.

My research was revolving around novel computer vision algorithms for object tracking,
with a focus on methods that are applicable to a wide range of object classes and scenarios
while not requiring any manual adaptation or re-training (model-free object tracking).

The main result of my work as a PhD student is the algorithm [CMT](/cmt)
that allows for tracking deformable objects.

During my master's program I created a [C++ implementation of Zdenek Kalal's OpenTLD](/tld),
a tracking algorithm that sparked [quite some interest in popular media][3].
